# Alpha Youth Course

Welcome to the Alpha Youth Course repository! This repository contains resources, guidelines, and information for running and participating in the Alpha Youth course.

## What is Alpha Youth?

**Alpha Youth** is an engaging and interactive course designed to help young people explore the basics of the Christian faith. It is a youth-focused version of the broader Alpha course, tailored specifically for teenagers and young adults, typically between the ages of 13 and 18.

The course provides a safe and welcoming environment where young people can ask big questions about life, faith, and God. It is not about forcing beliefs but offering a space for open dialogue.

## Course Structure

The Alpha Youth course usually consists of 9 to 12 sessions, each structured as follows:

1. **Welcome & Food**: Each session begins with a meal or snacks, creating a relaxed atmosphere for participants to connect.
2. **Watch**: Participants watch a dynamic and engaging video that covers essential topics like:
   - Who is Jesus?
   - Why and how should I pray?
   - How can I have faith?
3. **Discussion**: After the video, small groups discuss the topic, allowing participants to share their thoughts, ask questions, and explore ideas together.

## Topics Covered

The course covers a range of foundational topics, including:

- **Who is Jesus?**
- **Why did Jesus die?**
- **How can I have faith?**
- **Why and how do I pray?**
- **Why and how should I read the Bible?**
- **How does God guide us?**
